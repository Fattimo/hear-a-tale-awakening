Edna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish, to have&nbsp;stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon the tiles.&nbsp;She was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such futile expedients.&nbsp;She began to do as she liked and to feel as she liked. She completely abandoned&nbsp;her Tuesdays at home, and did not return the visits of those who had called&nbsp;upon her. She made no ineffectual efforts to conduct her household en bonne&nbsp;ménagère, going and coming as it suited her fancy, and, so far as she was&nbsp;able, lending herself to any passing caprice.
Mr. Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met a certain&nbsp;tacit submissiveness in his wife. But her new and unexpected line of conduct&nbsp;completely bewildered him. It shocked him. Then her absolute disregard for&nbsp;her duties as a wife angered him. When Mr. Pontellier became rude, Edna grew&nbsp;insolent.
