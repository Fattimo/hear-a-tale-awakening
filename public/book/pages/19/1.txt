Edna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish, to have&nbspstamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon the tiles.&nbspShe was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such futile expedients.&nbspShe began to do as she liked and to feel as she liked. She completely abandoned&nbspher Tuesdays at home, and did not return the visits of those who had called&nbspupon her. She made no ineffectual efforts to conduct her household en bonne&nbspménagère, going and coming as it suited her fancy, and, so far as she was&nbspable, lending herself to any passing caprice.
Mr. Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met a certain&nbsptacit submissiveness in his wife. But her new and unexpected line of conduct&nbspcompletely bewildered him. It shocked him. Then her absolute disregard for&nbspher duties as a wife angered him. When Mr. Pontellier became rude, Edna grew&nbspinsolent.
