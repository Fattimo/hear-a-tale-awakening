     Edna could not help but think that it was very foolish, very childish,
to have stamped upon her wedding ring and smashed the crystal vase upon the
tiles. She was visited by no more outbursts, moving her to such futile expedients.
She began to do as she liked and to feel as she liked. She completely abandoned
her Tuesdays at home, and did not return the visits of those who had called
upon her. She made no ineffectual efforts to conduct her household en bonne
ménagère, going and coming as it suited her fancy, and, so far as she was
able, lending herself to any passing caprice.

     Mr. Pontellier had been a rather courteous husband so long as he met
a certain tacit submissiveness in his wife. But her new and unexpected line
of conduct completely bewildered him. It shocked him. Then her absolute disregard
for her duties as a wife angered him. When Mr. Pontellier became rude, Edna
grew insolent.
