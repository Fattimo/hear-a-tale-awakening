“Yes, to me. Why not? Don’t stir all the warmth out of your coffee; drink it. Though the letter might as well have been sent to you; it was nothing but Mrs. Pontellier from beginning to end.”
“Let me see it,” requested the young woman, entreatingly.
“No; a letter concerns no one but the person who writes it and the one to whom it is written.”
“Haven’t you just said it concerned me from beginning to end?”
“It was written about you, not to you. ‘Have you seen Mrs. Pontellier? How is she looking?’ he asks. ‘As Mrs. Pontellier says,’ or ‘as Mrs. Pontellier once said.’ ‘If Mrs. Pontellier should call upon you, play for her that Impromptu of Chopin’s, my favorite. I heard it here a day or two ago, but not as you play it. I should like to know how it affects her,’ and so on, as if he supposed we were constantly in each other’s society.”
“Let me see the letter.”
“Oh, no.”
“Have you answered it?”
“No.”
“Let me see the letter.”
“No, and again, no.”
“Then play the Impromptu for me.”
“It is growing late; what time do you have to be home?”
“Time doesn’t concern me. Your question seems a little rude. Play the Impromptu.”
“But you have told me nothing of yourself. What are you doing?”
