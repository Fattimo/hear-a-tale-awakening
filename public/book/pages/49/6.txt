His musket was gone; he was hatless and his face and clothing&nbspwere begrimed. Around his neck hung a gold chain and locket. The priest, bending&nbspover him, unclasped the chain and removed it from the dead soldierâ€™s neck.&nbspHe had grown used to the terrors of war and could face them unflinchingly;&nbspbut its pathos, someway, always brought the tears to his old, dim eyes.
The angelus was ringing half a mile away. The priest and the negro knelt and&nbspmurmured together the evening benediction and a prayer for the dead.
