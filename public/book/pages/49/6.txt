The priest, bending&nbsp;over him, unclasped the chain and removed it from the dead soldierâ€™s neck.&nbsp;He had grown used to the terrors of war and could face them unflinchingly;&nbsp;but its pathos, someway, always brought the tears to his old, dim eyes.
The angelus was ringing half a mile away. The priest and the negro knelt and&nbsp;murmured together the evening benediction and a prayer for the dead.
