photograph, and exclaimed:
“Alcée Arobin! What on earth is his picture doing here?”
“I tried to make a sketch of his head one day,” answered Edna, “and he thought&nbspthe photograph might help me. It was at the other house. I thought it had&nbspbeen left there. I must have packed it up with my drawing materials.”
“I should think you would give it back to him if you have finished with it.”
“Oh! I have a great many such photographs. I never think of returning them.&nbspThey don’t amount to anything.” Robert kept on looking at the picture.
“It seems to me—do you think his head worth drawing? Is he a friend of Mr.&nbspPontellier’s? You never said you knew him.”
“He isn’t a friend of Mr. Pontellier’s; he’s a friend of mine. I always knew&nbsphim—that is, it is only of late that I know him pretty well. But I’d rather&nbsptalk about you, and know what you have been seeing and doing and feeling out&nbspthere in Mexico.”
