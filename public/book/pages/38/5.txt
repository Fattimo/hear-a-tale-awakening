 her; and her senses kindled afresh in thinking of Robert’s words, the pressure
of his arms, and the feeling of his lips upon her own. She could picture at
that moment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one.
His expression of love had already given him to her in part. When she thought
that he was there at hand, waiting for her, she grew numb with the intoxication
of expectancy. It was so late; he would be asleep perhaps. She would awaken
him with a kiss. She hoped he would be asleep that she might arouse him with
her caresses.

     Still, she remembered Adèle’s voice whispering, “Think of the children;
think of them.” She meant to think of them; that determination had driven
into her soul like a death wound—but not to-night. To-morrow would be time
to think of everything.

     Robert was not waiting for her in the little parlor. He was nowhere at
hand. The house was empty.
