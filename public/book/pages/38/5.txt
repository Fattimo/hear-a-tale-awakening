her; and her senses kindled afresh in thinking of Robert’s words, the pressure&nbspof his arms, and the feeling of his lips upon her own. She could picture at&nbspthat moment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one.&nbspHis expression of love had already given him to her in part. When she thought&nbspthat he was there at hand, waiting for her, she grew numb with the intoxication&nbspof expectancy. It was so late; he would be asleep perhaps. She would awaken&nbsphim with a kiss. She hoped he would be asleep that she might arouse him with&nbspher caresses.
Still, she remembered Adèle’s voice whispering, “Think of the children; think&nbspof them.” She meant to think of them; that determination had driven into her&nbspsoul like a death wound—but not to-night. To-morrow would be time to think&nbspof everything.
Robert was not waiting for her in the little parlor. He was nowhere at hand.&nbspThe house was empty.
