her; and her senses kindled afresh in thinking of Robert’s words, the pressure&nbsp;of his arms, and the feeling of his lips upon her own. She could picture at&nbsp;that moment no greater bliss on earth than possession of the beloved one.&nbsp;His expression of love had already given him to her in part. When she thought&nbsp;that he was there at hand, waiting for her, she grew numb with the intoxication&nbsp;of expectancy. It was so late; he would be asleep perhaps. She would awaken&nbsp;him with a kiss. She hoped he would be asleep that she might arouse him with&nbsp;her caresses.
Still, she remembered Adèle’s voice whispering, “Think of the children; think&nbsp;of them.” She meant to think of them; that determination had driven into her&nbsp;soul like a death wound—but not to-night. To-morrow would be time to think&nbsp;of everything.
Robert was not waiting for her in the little parlor. He was nowhere at hand.&nbsp;The house was empty.
