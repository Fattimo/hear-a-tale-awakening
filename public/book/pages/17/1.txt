The Pontelliers possessed a very charming home on Esplanade Street in New Orleans.&nbspIt was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda, whose round, fluted&nbspcolumns supported the sloping roof. The house was painted a dazzling white;&nbspthe outside shutters, or jalousies, were green. In the yard, which was kept&nbspscrupulously neat, were flowers and plants of every description which flourishes&nbspin South Louisiana. Within doors the appointments were perfect after the conventional&nbsptype. The softest carpets and rugs covered the floors; rich and tasteful draperies&nbsphung at doors and windows. There were paintings, selected with judgment and&nbspdiscrimination, upon the walls. The cut glass, the silver, the heavy damask&nbspwhich daily appeared upon the table were the envy of many women whose husbands&nbspwere less generous than Mr. Pontellier.
Mr. Pontellier was very fond of walking about his house
