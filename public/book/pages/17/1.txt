The Pontelliers possessed a very charming home on Esplanade Street in New Orleans.&nbsp;It was a large, double cottage, with a broad front veranda, whose round, fluted&nbsp;columns supported the sloping roof. The house was painted a dazzling white;&nbsp;the outside shutters, or jalousies, were green. In the yard, which was kept&nbsp;scrupulously neat, were flowers and plants of every description which flourishes&nbsp;in South Louisiana. Within doors the appointments were perfect after the conventional&nbsp;type. The softest carpets and rugs covered the floors; rich and tasteful draperies&nbsp;hung at doors and windows. There were paintings, selected with judgment and&nbsp;discrimination, upon the walls. The cut glass, the silver, the heavy damask&nbsp;which daily appeared upon the table were the envy of many women whose husbands&nbsp;were less generous than Mr. Pontellier.
Mr. Pontellier was very fond of walking about his house
