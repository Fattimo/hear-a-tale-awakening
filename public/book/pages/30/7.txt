Mr. Merriman’s stories were always lame and lacking point, his wife seldom&nbsp;permitted him to complete them. She interrupted him to ask if he remembered&nbsp;the name of the author whose book she had bought the week before to send to&nbsp;a friend in Geneva. She was talking “books” with Mr. Gouvernail and trying&nbsp;to draw from him his opinion upon current literary topics. Her husband told&nbsp;the story of the Waco man privately to Miss Mayblunt, who pretended to be&nbsp;greatly amused and to think it extremely clever.
Mrs. Highcamp hung with languid but unaffected interest upon the warm and&nbsp;impetuous volubility of her left-hand neighbor, Victor Lebrun. Her attention&nbsp;was never for a moment withdrawn from him after seating herself at table;&nbsp;and when he turned to Mrs. Merriman, who was prettier and more vivacious than&nbsp;Mrs. Highcamp, she waited with easy indifference for an opportunity to reclaim&nbsp;his attention.
