Mr. Merriman’s stories were always lame and lacking point, his wife seldom&nbsppermitted him to complete them. She interrupted him to ask if he remembered&nbspthe name of the author whose book she had bought the week before to send to&nbspa friend in Geneva. She was talking “books” with Mr. Gouvernail and trying&nbspto draw from him his opinion upon current literary topics. Her husband told&nbspthe story of the Waco man privately to Miss Mayblunt, who pretended to be&nbspgreatly amused and to think it extremely clever.
Mrs. Highcamp hung with languid but unaffected interest upon the warm and&nbspimpetuous volubility of her left-hand neighbor, Victor Lebrun. Her attention&nbspwas never for a moment withdrawn from him after seating herself at table;&nbspand when he turned to Mrs. Merriman, who was prettier and more vivacious than&nbspMrs. Highcamp, she waited with easy indifference for an opportunity to reclaim&nbsphis attention.
