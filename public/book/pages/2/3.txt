Robert spoke of his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn, where fortune&nbsp;awaited him. He was always intending to go to Mexico, but some way never got&nbsp;there. Meanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in&nbsp;New Orleans, where an equal familiarity with English, French and Spanish gave&nbsp;him no small value as a clerk and correspondent.
He was spending his summer vacation, as he always did, with his mother at&nbsp;Grand Isle. In former times, before Robert could remember, “the house” had&nbsp;been a summer luxury of the Lebruns. Now, flanked by its dozen or more cottages,&nbsp;which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the “Quartier Français,”&nbsp;it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the easy and comfortable existence which&nbsp;appeared to be her birthright.
Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father’s Mississippi plantation and her girlhood&nbsp;home in the old Kentucky blue-grass country.
