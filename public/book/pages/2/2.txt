Mrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch and&nbspbegan to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from&nbsphis cigarette. They chatted incessantly: about the things around them; their&nbspamusing adventure out in the water—it had again assumed its entertaining aspect;&nbspabout the wind, the trees, the people who had gone to the Chênière; about&nbspthe children playing croquet under the oaks, and the Farival twins, who were&nbspnow performing the overture to “The Poet and the Peasant.”
Robert talked a good deal about himself. He was very young, and did not know&nbspany better. Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason.&nbspEach was interested in what the other said.
