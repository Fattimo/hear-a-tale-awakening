pronounced than it would otherwise have been. There rested no shadow of care
upon his open countenance. His eyes gathered in and reflected the light and
languor of the summer day.
     Mrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch
and began to fan herself, while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from
his cigarette. They chatted incessantly: about the things around them; their
amusing adventure out in the water—it had again assumed its entertaining aspect;
about the wind, the trees, the people who had gone to the Chênière; about
the children playing croquet under the oaks, and the Farival twins, who were
now performing the overture to “The Poet and the Peasant.”
     Robert talked a good deal about himself. He was very young, and did not
know any better. Mrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same
reason. Each was interested in what the other said.
