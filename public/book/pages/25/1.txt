When the weather was dark and cloudy Edna could not work. She needed the sun&nbspto mellow and temper her mood to the sticking point. She had reached a stage&nbspwhen she seemed to be no longer feeling her way, working, when in the humor,&nbspwith sureness and ease. And being devoid of ambition, and striving not toward&nbspaccomplishment, she drew satisfaction from the work in itself.
