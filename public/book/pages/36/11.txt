you who awoke me last summer out of a life-long, stupid dream. Oh! you have&nbsp;made me so unhappy with your indifference. Oh! I have suffered, suffered!&nbsp;Now you are here we shall love each other, my Robert. We shall be everything&nbsp;to each other. Nothing else in the world is of any consequence. I must go&nbsp;to my friend; but you will wait for me? No matter how late; you will wait&nbsp;for me, Robert?”
“Don’t go; don’t go! Oh! Edna, stay with me,” he pleaded. “Why should you&nbsp;go? Stay with me, stay with me.”
“I shall come back as soon as I can; I shall find you here.” She buried her&nbsp;face in his neck, and said good-by again. Her seductive voice, together with&nbsp;his great love for her, had enthralled his senses, had deprived him of every&nbsp;impulse but the longing to hold her and keep her.
