you who awoke me last summer out of a life-long, stupid dream. Oh! you have&nbspmade me so unhappy with your indifference. Oh! I have suffered, suffered!&nbspNow you are here we shall love each other, my Robert. We shall be everything&nbspto each other. Nothing else in the world is of any consequence. I must go&nbspto my friend; but you will wait for me? No matter how late; you will wait&nbspfor me, Robert?”
“Don’t go; don’t go! Oh! Edna, stay with me,” he pleaded. “Why should you&nbspgo? Stay with me, stay with me.”
“I shall come back as soon as I can; I shall find you here.” She buried her&nbspface in his neck, and said good-by again. Her seductive voice, together with&nbsphis great love for her, had enthralled his senses, had deprived him of every&nbspimpulse but the longing to hold her and keep her.
