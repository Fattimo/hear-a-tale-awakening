moving procession of human energy; greater than the palpitating earth and the&nbspthings growing thereon. Oh! I could weep at being left by the wayside; left&nbspwith the grass and the clouds and a few dumb animals. True, I feel at home&nbspin the society of these symbols of life’s immutability. In the procession&nbspI should feel the crushing feet, the clashing discords, the ruthless hands&nbspand stifling breath. I could not hear the rhythm of the march.
Salve! ye dumb hearts. Let us be still and wait by the roadside.
