glove counter, and a pretty, pleasant young creature, delicate and deft of&nbsptouch, drew a long-wristed “kid” over Mrs. Sommers’s hand. She smoothed it&nbspdown over the wrist and buttoned it neatly, and both lost themselves for a&nbspsecond or two in admiring contemplation of the little symmetrical gloved hand.&nbspBut there were other places where money might be spent.
There were books and magazines piled up in the window of a stall a few paces&nbspdown the street. Mrs. Sommers bought two high-priced magazines such as she&nbsphad been accustomed to read in the days when she had been accustomed to other&nbsppleasant things. She carried them without wrapping. As well as she could she&nbsplifted her skirts at the crossings. Her stockings and boots and well fitting&nbspgloves had worked marvels in her bearing—had given her a feeling of assurance,&nbspa sense of belonging to the well-dressed multitude.
She was very hungry.
