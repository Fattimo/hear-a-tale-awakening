glove counter, and a pretty, pleasant young creature, delicate and deft of&nbsp;touch, drew a long-wristed “kid” over Mrs. Sommers’s hand. She smoothed it&nbsp;down over the wrist and buttoned it neatly, and both lost themselves for a&nbsp;second or two in admiring contemplation of the little symmetrical gloved hand.&nbsp;But there were other places where money might be spent.
There were books and magazines piled up in the window of a stall a few paces&nbsp;down the street. Mrs. Sommers bought two high-priced magazines such as she&nbsp;had been accustomed to read in the days when she had been accustomed to other&nbsp;pleasant things. She carried them without wrapping. As well as she could she&nbsp;lifted her skirts at the crossings. Her stockings and boots and well fitting&nbsp;gloves had worked marvels in her bearing—had given her a feeling of assurance,&nbsp;a sense of belonging to the well-dressed multitude.
She was very hungry.
