glove counter, and a pretty, pleasant young creature, delicate and deft of touch,
drew a long-wristed “kid” over Mrs. Sommers’s hand. She smoothed it down over
the wrist and buttoned it neatly, and both lost themselves for a second or two in
admiring contemplation of the little symmetrical gloved hand. But there were
other places where money might be spent.
There were books and magazines piled up in the window of a stall a few paces
down the street. Mrs. Sommers bought two high-priced magazines such as she
had been accustomed to read in the days when she had been accustomed to other
pleasant things. She carried them without wrapping. As well as she could she
lifted her skirts at the crossings. Her stockings and boots and well fitting gloves
had worked marvels in her bearing—had given her a feeling of assurance, a sense
of belonging to the well-dressed multitude.
She was very hungry.
