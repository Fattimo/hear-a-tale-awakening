However, before the year ended, she proposed, wholly from herself, to have&nbspGouvernail visit them again. Her husband was surprised and delighted with&nbspthe suggestion coming from her.
“I am glad, chère amie, to know that you have finally overcome your dislike&nbspfor him; truly he did not deserve it.”
“Oh,” she told him, laughingly, after pressing a long, tender kiss upon his&nbsplips, “I have overcome everything! you will see. This time I shall be very&nbspnice to him.”
