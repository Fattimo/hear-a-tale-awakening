strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky! how delicious! She&nbsp;felt like some new-born creature, opening its eyes in a familiar world that&nbsp;it had never known.
The foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet, and coiled like serpents about&nbsp;her ankles. She walked out. The water was chill, but she walked on. The water&nbsp;was deep, but she lifted her white body and reached out with a long, sweeping&nbsp;stroke. The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft,&nbsp;close embrace.
She went on and on. She remembered the night she swam far out, and recalled&nbsp;the terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to regain the shore.&nbsp;She did not look back now, but went on and on, thinking of the blue-grass&nbsp;meadow that she had traversed when a little child, believing that it had no&nbsp;beginning and no end.
Her arms and legs were growing tired.
She thought of LÃ©once and the children.
