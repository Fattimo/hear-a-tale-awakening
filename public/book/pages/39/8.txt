strange and awful it seemed to stand naked under the sky! how delicious! She&nbspfelt like some new-born creature, opening its eyes in a familiar world that&nbspit had never known.
The foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet, and coiled like serpents about&nbspher ankles. She walked out. The water was chill, but she walked on. The water&nbspwas deep, but she lifted her white body and reached out with a long, sweeping&nbspstroke. The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft,&nbspclose embrace.
She went on and on. She remembered the night she swam far out, and recalled&nbspthe terror that seized her at the fear of being unable to regain the shore.&nbspShe did not look back now, but went on and on, thinking of the blue-grass&nbspmeadow that she had traversed when a little child, believing that it had no&nbspbeginning and no end.
Her arms and legs were growing tired.
She thought of LÃ©once and the children.
