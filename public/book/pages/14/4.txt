She wondered why Robert had gone away and left her. It did not occur to her&nbsp;to think he might have grown tired of being with her the livelong day. She&nbsp;was not tired, and she felt that he was not. She regretted that he had gone.&nbsp;It was so much more natural to have him stay when he was not absolutely required&nbsp;to leave her.
As Edna waited for her husband she sang low a little song that Robert had&nbsp;sung as they crossed the bay. It began with “Ah! si tu savais,” and every&nbsp;verse ended with “si tu savais.”
Robert’s voice was not pretentious. It was musical and true. The voice, the&nbsp;notes, the whole refrain haunted her memory.
