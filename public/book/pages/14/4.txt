She wondered why Robert had gone away and left her. It did not occur to her&nbspto think he might have grown tired of being with her the livelong day. She&nbspwas not tired, and she felt that he was not. She regretted that he had gone.&nbspIt was so much more natural to have him stay when he was not absolutely required&nbspto leave her.
As Edna waited for her husband she sang low a little song that Robert had&nbspsung as they crossed the bay. It began with “Ah! si tu savais,” and every&nbspverse ended with “si tu savais.”
Robert’s voice was not pretentious. It was musical and true. The voice, the&nbspnotes, the whole refrain haunted her memory.
