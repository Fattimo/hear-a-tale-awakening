you would call the essential, or what you mean by the unessential,” said Madame&nbsp;Ratignolle, cheerfully; “but a woman who would give her life for her children&nbsp;could do no more than that—your Bible tells you so. I’m sure I couldn’t do&nbsp;more than that.”
“Oh, yes you could!” laughed Edna.
She was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz’s question the morning that lady,&nbsp;following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she did&nbsp;not greatly miss her young friend.
“Oh, good morning, Mademoiselle; is it you? Why, of course I miss Robert.&nbsp;Are you going down to bathe?”
“Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I haven’t&nbsp;been in the surf all summer,” replied the woman, disagreeably.
“I beg your pardon,” offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she should have&nbsp;remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz’s avoidance of the water had furnished&nbsp;a theme for much pleasantry.
