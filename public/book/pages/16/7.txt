you would call the essential, or what you mean by the unessential,” said Madame
Ratignolle, cheerfully; “but a woman who would give her life for her children
could do no more than that—your Bible tells you so. I’m sure I couldn’t do
more than that.”
     “Oh, yes you could!” laughed Edna.
     She was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz’s question the morning that
lady, following her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked if
she did not greatly miss her young friend.
     “Oh, good morning, Mademoiselle; is it you? Why, of course I miss Robert.
Are you going down to bathe?”
     “Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I haven’t
been in the surf all summer,” replied the woman, disagreeably.
     “I beg your pardon,” offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she should
have remembered that Mademoiselle Reisz’s avoidance of the water had furnished
a theme for much pleasantry.
