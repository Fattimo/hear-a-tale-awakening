you would call the essential, or what you mean by the unessential,” said Madame&nbspRatignolle, cheerfully; “but a woman who would give her life for her children&nbspcould do no more than that—your Bible tells you so. I’m sure I couldn’t do&nbspmore than that.”
“Oh, yes you could!” laughed Edna.
She was not surprised at Mademoiselle Reisz’s question the morning that lady,&nbspfollowing her to the beach, tapped her on the shoulder and asked if she did&nbspnot greatly miss her young friend.
“Oh, good morning, Mademoiselle; is it you? Why, of course I miss Robert.&nbspAre you going down to bathe?”
“Why should I go down to bathe at the very end of the season when I haven’t&nbspbeen in the surf all summer,” replied the woman, disagreeably.
“I beg your pardon,” offered Edna, in some embarrassment, for she should have&nbspremembered that Mademoiselle Reisz’s avoidance of the water had furnished&nbspa theme for much pleasantry.
