A feeling of oppression and drowsiness overcame Edna during the service. Her&nbsphead began to ache, and the lights on the altar swayed before her eyes. Another&nbsptime she might have made an effort to regain her composure; but her one thought&nbspwas to quit the stifling atmosphere of the church and reach the open air.&nbspShe arose, climbing over Robert’s feet with a muttered apology. Old Monsieur&nbspFarival, flurried, curious, stood up, but upon seeing that Robert had followed&nbspMrs. Pontellier, he sank back into his seat. He whispered an anxious inquiry&nbspof the lady in black, who did not notice him or reply, but kept her eyes fastened&nbspupon the pages of her velvet prayer-book.
“I felt giddy and almost overcome,” Edna said, lifting her hands instinctively&nbspto her head and pushing her straw hat up from her forehead. “I couldn’t have&nbspstayed through the service.” They were outside in the shadow of the church.
